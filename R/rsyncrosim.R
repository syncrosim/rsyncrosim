#' rsyncrosim: The R interface to SyncroSim: http://syncrosim.com/
#'
#' rsyncrosim provides an interface to SyncroSim, a generalized framework for
#' running and managing scenario-based stochastic simulations over space and time.
#' Different kinds of simulation models can "plug-in" to SyncroSim as modules and
#' take advantage of general features common to many kinds of simulation models,
#' such as defining scenarios of model inputs, running Monte Carlo simulations,
#' and viewing charts and maps of outputs.
