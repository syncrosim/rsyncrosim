#' rsyncrosim: The R interface to SyncroSim: http://syncrosim.com/
#'
#' rsyncrosim provides an interface to SyncroSim, a generalized framework for
#' running and managing scenario-based stochastic simulations over space and time.
#' Different kinds of simulation models can "plug-in" to SyncroSim as packages and
#' take advantage of general features common to many kinds of simulation models,
#' such as defining scenarios of inputs, running Monte Carlo simulations, and
#' viewing charts and maps of outputs.
#'
#' To learn more about rsyncrosim, start with the vignette 
#' (`r browseVignettes("rsyncrosim")`).
