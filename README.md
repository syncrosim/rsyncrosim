## About SyncroSim

  - **Automatically structure your data:** SyncroSim ties together your
    existing data from disparate formats, such as Excel, CSV, and
    GeoTIFF. No database is required – SyncroSim automatically
    structures your data files for you.

  - **Use your data to make predictions:** SyncroSim allows you to chain
    together “models” – including existing off-the-shelf programs and
    scripts written in languages such as R, Python and C\# – to
    transform your data into predictions.

  - **Engage decision makers:** No longer are forecasts delivered by
    analysts as static reports. Through its unique, easy-to-use
    interface, SyncroSim allows non-technical users to define, run and
    track their own “what-if” scenarios using the original data and
    models.

  - **Go big:** SyncroSim is specifically designed to handle big data,
    including support for cloud computing, multiprocessing, and large
    rasters.
