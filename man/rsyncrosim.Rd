\title{rsyncrosim: The R interface to SyncroSim: http://syncrosim.com/}
\description{
rsyncrosim provides an interface to SyncroSim, a generalized framework for
running and managing scenario-based stochastic simulations over space and time.
Different kinds of simulation models can "plug-in" to SyncroSim as packages and
take advantage of general features common to many kinds of simulation models,
such as defining scenarios of inputs, running Monte Carlo simulations, and
viewing charts and maps of outputs.
